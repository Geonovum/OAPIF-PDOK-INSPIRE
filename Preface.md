### Preface

This document describes the recommendations that were derived from setting up a test bed with OGC API features conform INSPIRE at the Dutch Hosting organization [PDOK](https://www.pdok.nl/).
The document is meant for INSPIRE Data providers, Data hosting organizations like PDOK, and the European INSPIRE community.

OGC API features (OAPIF) are a download service by means of an API (Application Program Interface) based on OGC standards. They have been considered as follow up for the OGC WFS standard, but that does not mean it will replace it.
They are complementary to each other. Where WFS is mainly known and used in the GIS community, the OAPIF is aiming at the non GIS-community, like web developers. They are easier to use and need less knowledge in the spatial domain.

Because of this Geonovum hopes to reach more users of INSPIRE data when OAPIF's are being served. The focus of this document will mainly be on INSPIRE aspects.

### Reading advice

The approach is described in the next chapter. It also describes the main stakeholders and requirements that were set in advance.
After that, the results are presented and finally the recommendations for future steps are listed.

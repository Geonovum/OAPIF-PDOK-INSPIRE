### Preface

This document describes the recommendations that were derived from setting up a test bed with OGC API features conform INSPIRE at the Dutch hosting organization [PDOK](https://www.pdok.nl/) and at the [Geonovum testbed for OGC API features](https://github.com/Geonovum/ogc-api-testbed).
The document is meant for INSPIRE Data providers, Data hosting organizations like PDOK, and the European INSPIRE community.

OGC API features (OAPIF) are a download service by means of an API (Application Program Interface) based on OGC standards. They have been considered as follow up for the OGC WFS standard, but that does not mean it will replace it in the near future, although it might happen in a later future.
They are complementary to each other. Where WFS is mainly known and used in the GIS community, the OAPIF is aiming at the non GIS-community, like web developers. They are easier to use and need less knowledge in the spatial domain.
Another drive behind the use of OAPIF, is the requirement to use API's for the High Value Datasets as stated in the Open data directive.

Because of this, Geonovum hopes to stimulate data providers to serve their INSPIRE data with OAPIF. The focus of this document will mainly be on INSPIRE aspects.
The underlying research aimed at implementing OAPIF services with all the INSPIRE requirements in mind. A main research question is, whether there are any barriers caused by the INSPIRE requirements, when implementing an OAPIF service


### Reading advice

The approach is described in the next chapter. It also describes the main stakeholders and requirements that were set in advance.
After that, the results are presented, the recommendations for future steps are listed and finally some conclusions are listed.

### Preface

OGC API features (OAPIF) are a download service by means of an API (Application Program Interface) based on OGC standards. 
They have been considered as follow up for the OGC WFS standard, but that does not mean it will replace it in the near future, although it might happen in a later future.
They are complementary to each other. Where WFS is mainly known and used in the GIS community, the OAPIF is aiming at the non GIS-community, like web developers. 
They are easier to use and need less knowledge in the spatial domain.
Another drive behind the use of OAPIF, is the requirement to use API's for the High Value Datasets as stated in the Open data directive.
Because of this, Geonovum hopes to stimulate data providers with this guideline to serve their INSPIRE data with OAPIF. The focus of this document will mainly be on INSPIRE aspects.

This document is a guideline for Dutch INSPIRE dataproviders who want to use OGC-API-Features to fulfill their INSPIRE obligations for download services.
It describes the requirements that are relevant to INSPIRE downloadservices. The requirements are based on the following documents:
1. OGC-API-Features standards (Part 1 en Part 2), [[PUB-1]] en [[PUB-5]]
2. Working group for setting up an INSPIRE Download service based on the OGC API-Features standard. INSPIRE-MIF. V1.0.[[PUB-2]]
3. Dutch API design rules,[[PUB-3]]

The basic characteristics of OAPIF are described in the next chapter.
After that the requirement for INSPIRE compliancy are discussed.
Four examples show how requirements can be met. Unfortunately, non of the examples fulfill all requirements.
A roadmap is given for setting up your own OGC-API-Features service, along with the barriers that can be encountered.
The document ends with some recommandations for hosting organizations and the INSPIRE community and finally some conclusions.

# OAPIF-PDOK-INSPIRE

This is the repository for sharing documentation and results of tests for using OGC API Features for INSPIRE in the Netherlands in May 2021.
It concerns a test with the Dutch hosting organisation PDOK and tests on the Geonovum testbed.
The original report on the findings can be found in: https://geonovum.github.io/OAPIF-PDOK-INSPIRE/

A major result was that existing tools for serving OGC-API-feature services were not adjusted to the standards. 
This resulted in an open tender for adjusting these tools. As a result from that tender, 3 tools were adjusted in the beginning of 2023.
How they now do comply to the standards is shown in the new [Guideline](https://geonovum.github.io/ogc-api-features-guideline)

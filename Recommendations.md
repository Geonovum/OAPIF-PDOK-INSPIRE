## Recommendations

Recommendations can be divided in recommendations for a hosting organization like [PDOK](https://www.pdok.nl), recommendations for the INSPIRE data provider and recommendations for the INSPIRE community.

### Recommendations for a Hosting organization

1. Figure out the best way of supporting more than one CRS, and at least [WGS84](https://epsg.io/4326) and [ETRS89](https://epsg.io/4258) since the last is the most common in INSPIRE
2. Stimulate data providers who want OAPIF as a download service for their harmonized INSPIRE data to define the mapping of this data to an alternative encodings together with other data poviders in Europe. In case of PDOK, this means geopackage for input, and json for output.
3. Follow the developments of the alternative encodings
4. Discuss recommendation 3 for the data provider with the data provider
5. Research how the metadata of the OAPIF service should look like
6. Try to reach other data providers that are interested in OAPIF service
7. Try to reach users for the OAPIF services
8. Consider leaving out the empty fields, or use an option not to show them
9. Give a result for https://api.pdok.nl/geonovum/oaf/v1_0/collections/addresses/queryables?f=html to show all attributes and make it possible to filter on their values
10. Implement filters other than bbox and items

### Recommendations for INSPIRE data providers

1. Before you start, look what other member states have done in this field for the concerning INSPIRE themes.
2. When hosting at PDOK you have to discuss the mapping of your harmonized data to other encodings together with other data poviders in Europe and use the principles as stated in [[PUB-4]]
3. When a working INSPIRE OAPIF is published with a well described mapping to json it should be shared at https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2/tree/master/resources/examples. 
This could initiate a [Good Practice procedure](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library) as stated in [issues nr 9 of the INSPIRE helpdesk](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/issues/9) 
4. Adjust your metadata of the dataset with the extra OAPIF service. As long as there is no official protocol defined in https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ProtocolValue:1, use the type "Other". The extended codelist for the protocol in the Dutch metadata standard 2.1.0 (https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/md/mdprofiel-iso19119/#codelist-protocol) contains: "OGC:API features"

### Recommendations for the INSPIRE community

1. Stimulate a centralized establishment for rules on mapping the INSPIRE data for each feature type that exists within the INSPIRE data specifications to other encodings like json, geopackage and in some cases theme specific encodings like SDMX for statistics. 
[[PUB-4]] for json and for [geopackages](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-geopackage-encodings) are a very good start, but it needs to be specified per INSPIRE feature type per INSPIRE theme.
If this is not organized, each EU member will try it on their own, with the result of no data interoperability. It is important for the OAPIF, because the input and output of many OAPIF implementations are based on these encodings, although [[PUB-1]] does not bound you to these alternative encodings. GML is also allowed. 
2. Develop validation tool for these encodings, otherwise the encodings will stay additional in stead of alternative encodings for GML, since at the moment only validators for GML exist.
3. Specify a protocol for OAPIF like: OGC:OAPIF of OGC:OAF to be used in the metadata
4. Look at the issues in the [European INSPIRE helpdesk](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk) and specially [issue nr 9](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/issues/9)

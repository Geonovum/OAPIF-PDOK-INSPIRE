An aditional requirement could be testing with: https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-ogcapi-features10

  The executable test suite for the  OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core (OGC 17-069r3) is now available in the OGC Validation beta environment:
 
  http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/

  We require three early implementations to move the test to production. So far we have one passing the test:

  ldproxy -  https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldprox : https://services.interactive-instruments.de/t15/daraa


  If you want to be consider an early implementer:

  1. Register your implementation in the OGC database: https://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/registration
  2. Then link your implementation to the test results in the beta website.  
  3. Your implementation will then appear in the OGC database as an official early implementation and we will waive the license fee for the first year.
